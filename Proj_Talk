Chat-generated game idea:
  Microbe Mayhem – Immune System Defense
  
  Genre: Tower defense / action-strategy
  Educational Focus: Innate vs. adaptive immunity, pathogen types
  
  Pitch:
  You control the body’s immune cells as pathogens invade. Place “towers” such as macrophages and neutrophils, then later unlock adaptive units like T-cells and B-cells. Resources come from nutrients absorbed via a simulated bloodstream mechanic.
  Players learn:
  
  Differences between bacteria, viruses, fungi
  
  Immune system timing (innate response early, adaptive later)
  
  Why nutrition and rest matter for immune function
  
  Love2D Fit: Beautiful particle effects for antibodies, simple grid placement logic, pathfinding for pathogens.
