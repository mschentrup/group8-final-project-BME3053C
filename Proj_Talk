  Microbe Mayhem – Immune System Defense
  
  Genre: Tower defense / action-strategy
  Educational Focus: Innate vs. adaptive immunity, pathogen types
  
  Pitch:
  You control the body’s immune cells as pathogens invade. Place “towers” such as macrophages and neutrophils, then later unlock adaptive units like T-cells and B-cells. Resources come from nutrients absorbed via a simulated bloodstream mechanic.
  Players learn:
  
  Differences between bacteria, viruses, fungi
  
  Immune system timing (innate response early, adaptive later)
  
  Why nutrition and rest matter for immune function
  
  Love2D Fit: Beautiful particle effects for antibodies, simple grid placement logic, pathfinding for pathogens.


Types of Immune cells (towers) 
    Neutrophils → Most abundant; first responders that engulf bacteria and fungi.
    Eosinophils → Target larger parasites; also modulate allergic responses.
    Macrophages → “Big eaters” that engulf pathogens, dead cells, and debris.
    Dendritic Cells → Capture antigens and present them to T-cells, bridging innate and adaptive immunity
    B Cells → Produce antibodies; differentiate into plasma cells and memory B cells.
    Helper T Cells (CD4+) → Coordinate immune responses.
    Cytotoxic T Cells (CD8+) → Kill infected or cancerous cells.
      - maybe there is a random chance one of you cells becomes cancerous, and you can only kill these with the cytotoxic t cells
    Regulatory T Cells → Suppress excessive immune reactions.
    Natural Killer (NK) Cells → Destroy virus-infected and tumor cells without prior sensitization
Immune Response Factors:
    We could have things like oxygen levels, zinc levels, Vitamin D levels, and iron levels be things that players have to monitor
    We could also have random "weather" conditions happen that suppress certain types of cells, like stress, slowing down the T cell towers
